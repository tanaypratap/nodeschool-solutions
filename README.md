My solutions of nodeschool node's questions when I started to learn in 2015. The programming style might not be correct as per JS standards as I was just starting that time and had little to no idea. I am posting it so that it can be useful to someone like me and keep the focus on the solving logic using JS instead of an in-depth JS knowledge to begin with.

Node School provides small programming exercises to get you familiar with javascript ecosystem.
